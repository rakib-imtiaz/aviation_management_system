    3. Flight Management: The system will manage flight schedules, including departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, and flight duration.
    4. Passenger Management: The system will manage passenger bookings, including passenger information, seat assignments, and check-in records.
    5. Maintenance Management: The system will manage maintenance records, including maintenance dates, descriptions, and fuel consumption.
    6. Catering Management: The system will manage catering records, including catering dates, menus, and passenger preferences.
    7. Baggage Management: The system will manage baggage records, including baggage type, passenger information, and flight assignments.
    8. Check-in Management: The system will manage check-in records, including check-in times, passenger information, and flight assignments.
    9. Flight Statistics: The system will generate flight statistics, including departure and arrival delays, flight duration, and passenger satisfaction ratings.
